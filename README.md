# Computer Science Beginner BootCamp - PreTest

This repository is used to test the basic programming level of the participants in the Computer Science Beginner BootCamp.

## Questions

Write a program for at least one of these questions. You can use any programming language.

1. Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
2. Write a program that accepts a string as input and counts the frequency of each character in the string. The output should be a dictionary where the keys are the characters and the values are their corresponding frequencies.
3. Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
